	<p>Flowers are the reproductive structures of flowering plants, playing a crucial role in the life cycle of these plants. They consist of four main parts: sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. Each part has a specific function, contributing to the plant's ability to reproduce and produce seeds and fruits. Flowers can be classified as complete or incomplete, with complete flowers containing all four whorls of parts. They are essential for pollination, attracting pollinators, and facilitating the reproduction process. Flowers also serve as a food source for various organisms, supporting biodiversity and ecosystem health.</p>
